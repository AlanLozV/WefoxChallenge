The repository includes "Exploratory Testing.md" archive which includes all the notes written regarding an exploratory test performed over a booking website.

It also includes the project of the automation test performed over the Lego website which main goal is to access the site, filter by age (3-5 years old), 
then by keychains under 20â‚¬. Assert that the number of results is correct. Check the article name and price. Drop in in the cart and proceed to checkout. 
Verify all details (item name, price, units, total amount) are correct.

The archive "Reflection Automated Test.md" is also in this repository and it is a quick overview of the automated test and describes the pros and cons of
approaching the test case with different scopes of functional testing.
